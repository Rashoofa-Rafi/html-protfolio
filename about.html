            My expertise lies in managing complex projects from conception to completion, ensuring adherence to timelines, budgets, and quality standards. As an Instrument Technician, I have gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting, calibration, and maintenance of a wide range of instruments and control systems. This knowledge has proven invaluable in my subsequent roles as an Electrical and Instrument Team Lead, where I oversaw teams, coordinated resources, and optimized workflows to deliver exceptional results
